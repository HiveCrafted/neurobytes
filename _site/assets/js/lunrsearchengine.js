    "title": "Stoicism as a Way of Life Pt. 2",
    "body": "2021/02/21 - How do you practice stoicism throughout your daily life? While the stoic philosophers we mentioned in Part 1 left us with some insight in this area, incorporating other self-help frameworks that align with stoicism’s ideals can offer us a more practical guidebook to living “the stoic way. ” One framework worth considering is The Four Agreements, first described by authors Don Miguel Ruiz and Janet Mills in their 1997 book. Another book, titled The Fifth Agreement, furthered their theories when published in 2010. According to the Agreements, all of our actions and behaviors are based on hidden agreements we’ve made with ourselves, other people, and with life itself. These agreements are expressed as deep beliefs ingrained at an early age that define the borders for us as to what is or is not possible. Without thought and intention, some of the agreements we make can be self-limiting and self-defeating, so the authors of the Agreements propose five healthy versions meant to help people live a virtuous life and meet their full potential. In studying the Agreements, we can see that many of them overlap with tenets of stoicism. 1. Be impeccable with your word. :  “The chief task in life is simply this: to identify and separate matters so that I can say clearly to myself which are externals not under my control, and which have to do with the choices I actually control. Where then do I look for good and evil? Not to uncontrollable externals, but within myself to the choices that are my own…”— Epictetus  “Better to trip with the feet than the tongue. ”— Zeno Epictetus taught us that the heart of the stoic philosophy is the concept that many matters are outside of our control, except our choices, which are fully within our control. Our word then is a powerful tool, because not only is it something within our control, but it’s how we communicate to others what our intentions are and tell them what to expect from us. At its core, our word and how we use it is one of the most important ways we interact with others in the world. If he were alive today, Epictetus would surely agree with the authors of the Four Agreements that being impeccable with your word is a commitment to take seriously. He might also point out that keeping our word in matters concerning ourselves is just as important as keeping it when dealing with other people. Over-promising, under-delivering, and generally not following through will not only earn you a poor reputation, but it will cause you to lose respect for yourself and compromise your own values. In order to live virtuously then, it’s incredibly important that we take great care with how we use our word and ensure we keep our commitments. 2. Don’t take anything personally. :  “Don’t take anything personally. Nothing others do is because of you. What others say and do is a projection of their own reality, their own dream. When you are immune to the opinions and actions of others, you won’t be the victim of needless suffering. — Don Miguel Ruiz  “Someone despises me. That’s their problem. Mine: not to do or say anything despicable. Someone hates me. Their problem. Mine: to be patient and cheerful with everyone, including them. Ready to show them their mistake. Not spitefully, or to show off my own self-control, but in an honest, upright way. ”— Marcus Aurelius  “When people injure you, ask yourself what good or harm they thought would come of it. If you understand that, you’ll feel sympathy rather than outrage or anger. Your sense of good and evil may be the same as theirs, or near it, in which case you have to excuse them. Or your sense of good and evil may differ from theirs. In which case they’re misguided and deserve your compassion. Is that so hard?”— Marcus Aurelius  “You don’t have to turn this into something. It doesn’t have to upset you. ” — Marcus Aurelius 3. Don’t make assumptions. :  “‘If you seek tranquillity, do less. ’ Or (more accurately) do what’s essential… Which brings a double satisfaction: to do less, better. Because most of what we say and do is not essential. If you can eliminate it, you’ll have more time, and more tranquillity. Ask yourself at every moment, “Is this necessary?” But we need to eliminate unnecessary assumptions as well to eliminate the unnecessary actions that follow. ”— Marcus Aurelius  “It is impossible to begin to learn that which one thinks one already knows. ” — Epictetus 4. Always do your best. :  “Waste no more time arguing what a good man should be. Be One. ”— Marcus Aurelius  “If anyone can refute me—show me I’m making a mistake or looking at things from the wrong perspective—I’ll gladly change. It’s the truth I’m after, and the truth never harmed anyone. ”— Marcus Aurelius  “Be tolerant with others and strict with yourself. ”— Marcus Aurelius  “Remind yourself that your task is to be a good human being; remind yourself what nature demands of people. Then do it, without hesitation, and speak the truth as you see it. But with kindness. With humility. Without hypocrisy. ”— Marcus Aurelius 5. Be skeptical, but learn to listen. :  “The first rule is to keep an untroubled spirit. The second is to look things in the face and know them for what they are. ”— Marcus Aurelius  “We have two ears and one mouth, therefore we should listen twice as much as we speak. ”— Zeno  “Nothing has such power to broaden the mind as the ability to investigate systematically and truly all that comes under thy observation in life. ”— Marcus Aurelius  “If you want to improve, be content to be thought foolish and stupid. ”― Epictetus "

    "body": "2021/02/15 -  “If someone else handed over your body to a person whom you encountered, you’d be furious; but that you hand over your mind to anyone who comes along, so that, if he abuses you, it becomes disturbed and confused, do you feel no shame at that?”— Epictetus The stoic mindset has been studied and adopted by Elon Musk, Bill Gates, Warren Buffett and other high achievers of today (as well as many influential people from the past, including George Washington, Thomas Jefferson and Ralph Waldo Emerson). Below we’ll explore why stoicism is considered an ideal productivity system by the highly successful entrepreneur and author Tim Ferriss. We’ll learn what it is, why and how it helps create changes in your life, why you might want to integrate some of its wisdom into your daily routines. There has been a surge in popularity in the past decade of “stoicism”, a highly practical approach to living that can lead to an abundance of internal peace as well as external success in our work and personal lives. The Stoicism Subreddit, started in 2009, grew its membership from 7k in 2013 to over 366k in 2021. While some in personal productivity communities are aware of what stoicism is, it remains relatively unknown to the general population. We can control how we approach things even if we cannot control what happens to us. We must learn to accept and work with reality while always striving to improve ourselves using these four cardinal virtues: Wisdom: the ability to navigate complex situations in a rational manner Temperance: the exercise of restraint and maintaining moderation in all aspects of life Justice: treating others fairly in all situations, even when they have done wrong Courage: facing daily and major challenges with clarity and integrity the “Floating Clouds of thought” concept: Zen, Buddhism and Stoicism: Stoicism has some interesting overlapping characteristics with Buddhism and Zen teachings. One principle that links Stoicism to traditions that value mindfulness meditation has to do with the reduction of thoughts within the mind. The experience that those who practice meditation report is that by quieting the mind, the naturally-occurring essence of the life within us not blocked by having our attention be held by thoughts. At the core of Stoicism is the notion that as individuals, there are only a few things that are within our control. By paying attention to the thoughts that create anxiety within us, we can then ask “is this something that I can either control or influence?” If not, then we allow it to be. We accept it as is, for it cannot at this moment be any other way. You cannot change the present moment. It is the inevitable result of all things that grew toward its current state. You only have one option in any moment, and that is in how you direct your awareness. You can choose what to focus on, where to put your attention, what to do and what to say. And through each moment’s choice, you participate in the creative unfolding of the future. Zen and Buddhist traditions teach that thoughts are like clouds in the sky, passing by, blocking the sun from time to time, but above them are always blue skies. We cannot control the clouds, meaning we cannot control the thoughts that pass through our minds. But we can choose to focus our awareness not on the thoughts but on something like our breathing, or body awareness. Through a different mechanism, but to a similar end, Stoicism trains us to have a natural reduction in the number of and frequency of recurring thoughts that may swim around in our heads and pop up to distract us from what is right in front of us. We have only one locus of control in our minds. We therefore can not be both allowing some thought to hold our attention which is not related either to a matter at hand which would benefit from your attention on it here and now, so in other words we cannot expect to be both preoccupied by some currently irrelevant and non-actionable thought, and also simultaneously be present and at our best#If we are not allowing our awareness to be as it was built to be, then we are allowing our power to be used. This can only happen at the highest level when we are “feeling the flow state”. This can only be felt when our awareness is here and now, enjoying the process of either creating something, improving something, or simply enjoying some experience. "

It reached its peak of fame as a restaurant and nightclub (a café-concert) in the last three decades of the 19th century. Always a center of entertainment for the aristocracy, in the 1870s it also became a regular destination of some of the best known figures of art and the demi-monde. Edgar Degas and Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec portrayed visitors at the night club, and Aristide Bruant performed there.  It was decorated in an 18th-century rococo style, redesigned by Sybille de Margérie with furnishings by Sonia Rykiel. Following a renovation of the hotel in 1981–85, the restaurant occupied a former private ballroom with windows looking out on the Place de la Concorde, a few hundred meters from the Palais Garnier. Les Ambassadeurs had two Michelin stars. In the last decade of its operation, chef was Dominique Bouchet followed by Jean-François Piège and finally when the hotel closed in 2013 for an extended renovation, Christopher Hache. In 2017 Hache opened a smaller restaurant, L’Écrin, within the renovated hotel; the former space of Les Ambassadeurs became a bar. "

    "body": "2020/02/01 - The Sahara is a desert located on the African continent. It is the largest hot desert in the world, and the third largest desert overall after Antarctica and the Arctic. Its area of 9,200,000 square kilometres (3,600,000 sq mi) is comparable to the area of China or the United States. [3] The name ‘Sahara’ is derived from a dialectal Arabic word for “desert”, ṣaḥra (صحرا /ˈsˤaħra/). The desert comprises much of North Africa, excluding the fertile region on the Mediterranean Sea coast, the Atlas Mountains of the Maghreb, and the Nile Valley in Egypt and Sudan. It stretches from the Red Sea in the east and the Mediterranean in the north to the Atlantic Ocean in the west, where the landscape gradually changes from desert to coastal plains. To the south, it is bounded by the Sahel, a belt of semi-arid tropical savanna around the Niger River valley and the Sudan Region of Sub-Saharan Africa. The Sahara can be divided into several regions including: the western Sahara, the central Ahaggar Mountains, the Tibesti Mountains, the Aïr Mountains, the Ténéré desert, and the Libyan Desert. For several hundred thousand years, the Sahara has alternated between desert and savanna grassland in a 20,000 year cycle caused by the precession of the Earth’s axis as it rotates around the Sun, which changes the location of the North African Monsoon. The area is next expected to become green in about 15,000 years (17,000 AD). "

    "body": "2020/01/12 - The Queen’s Guard and Queen’s Life Guard (called King’s Guard and King’s Life Guard when the reigning monarch is male) are the names given to contingents of infantry and cavalry soldiers charged with guarding the official royal residences in the United Kingdom. The British Army has regiments of both Horse Guards and Foot Guards predating the English Restoration (1660), and since the reign of King Charles II these regiments have been responsible for guarding the Sovereign’s palaces. The Guards are fully operational soldiers. The Queen’s Guard and Queen’s Life Guard are mounted at the royal residences that come under the operating area of the British Army’s London District, which is responsible for the administration of the Household Division. This covers Buckingham Palace, St James’s Palace and the Tower of London, as well as Windsor Castle. The Queen’s Guard is also mounted at the sovereign’s other official residence, the Palace of Holyroodhouse, but not as often as in London. In Edinburgh, the guard is the responsibility of the resident infantry battalion at Redford Barracks. It is not mounted at the Queen’s private residences at Sandringham or Balmoral.  The Queen’s Guard is the name given to the contingent of infantry responsible for guarding Buckingham Palace and St James’s Palace (including Clarence House) in London. The guard is made up of a company of soldiers from a single regiment, which is split in two, providing a detachment for Buckingham Palace and a detachment for St James’s Palace. Because the Sovereign’s official residence is still St James’s, the guard commander (called the captain of the guard) is based there, as are the regiment’s colours. When the Sovereign is in residence, the Queen’s Guard numbers three officers and forty other ranks, with four sentries each posted at Buckingham Palace (on the forecourt) and St James’s Palace (two in Friary Court, two at the entrance to Clarence House). This reduces to three officers and 31 ORs, with two sentries each, when the Sovereign is not in residence. The Queen’s Guard is not purely ceremonial in nature. They provide sentries during the day and night, and during the later hours, they patrol the grounds of the Palace. Until 1959, the sentries at Buckingham Palace were stationed outside the fence. This stopped following an incident involving a female tourist and a Coldstream Guardsman – due to the continued pestering by tourists and sightseers, the guardsman kicked the tourist on the ankle as he marched. The tourist made a complaint to the police and the sentry was confined to barracks for ten days. Not long after, the sentries were moved inside the fence. "

Education must also train one for quick, resolute and effective thinking. To think incisively and to think for one’s self is very difficult.  We are prone to let our mental life become invaded by legions of half truths, prejudices, and propaganda. At this point, I often wonder whether or not education is fulfilling its purpose. A great majority of the so-called educated people do not think logically and scientifically. Even the press, the classroom, the platform, and the pulpit in many instances do not give us objective and unbiased truths. To save man from the morass of propaganda, in my opinion, is one of the chief aims of education. Education must enable one to sift and weigh evidence, to discern the true from the false, the real from the unreal, and the facts from the fiction. The function of education, therefore, is to teach one to think intensively and to think critically. But education which stops with efficiency may prove the greatest menace to society. The most dangerous criminal may be the man gifted with reason, but with no morals. The late Eugene Talmadge, in my opinion, possessed one of the better minds of Georgia, or even America. Moreover, he wore the Phi Beta Kappa key. By all measuring rods, Mr. Talmadge could think critically and intensively; yet he contends that I am an inferior being. Are those the types of men we call educated? We must remember that intelligence is not enough. Intelligence plus character–that is the goal of true education. The complete education gives one not only power of concentration, but worthy objectives upon which to concentrate. The broad education will, therefore, transmit to one not only the accumulated knowledge of the race but also the accumulated experience of social living. "

As in many similar films, such as Jacob’s Ladder (1990), Soul Survivors (2001), and The Butterfly Effect (2004), events and people were thoroughly distorted and confused because the protagonist was at the point of death. The tagline was misleading: “When You Don’t Have a Memory, How Can You Remember Who to Trust?” The mind-warping film opened with a hospital patient Simon Cable (Ryan Phillippe) awakening in a hospital with little knowledge (amnesia perhaps?) of what had happened, and why he was there, etc. He was told by attending Dr. Jeremy Newman (Stephen Rea) that it was July 29, 2002 (Simon thought it was the year 2000 - he was confused - he heard a doctor say 20:00 hours!) and that he had died for two minutes from cardiac arrest following the near-fatal accident – but he had been revived (“You’re as good as new”). Dr. Newman: “Simon, this is the 29th of July. The year is 2002. And your wife, whose name is Anna, is waiting outside. ” What critiques say?:  “There’s almost no single moment in Portrait of a Lady on Fire that couldn’t be captured, mounted, and hung on a wall as high art. ” — Entertainment Weekly A major clue to everything that truly happened was the scene that played next under the credits - hospital staff failed to bring a patient back to life with a defibrillator after a car accident. Chest compressions failed and there was no pulse. A second major clue was provided by hospital orderly Travis (Stephen Graham): Everybody dies. No mystery there. But why and how everyone dies.

    "body": "2020/01/01 - French wine is produced all throughout France, in quantities between 50 and 60 million hectolitres per year, or 7–8 billion bottles. France is one of the largest wine producers in the world, along with Italian, Spanish, and American wine-producing regions.  French wine traces its history to the 6th century BC, with many of France’s regions dating their wine-making history to Roman times. The wines produced range from expensive wines sold internationally to modest wines usually only seen within France such as the Margnat wines were during the post war period. Two concepts central to the better French wines are the notion of terroir, which links the style of the wines to the locations where the grapes are grown and the wine is made and the Appellation d’origine contrôlée (AOC) system, replaced by the Appellation d’Origin Protégée (AOP) system in 2012. Appellation rules closely define which grape varieties and winemaking practices are approved for classification in each of France’s several hundred geographically defined appellations, which can cover regions, villages or vineyards. France is the source of many grape varieties (such as Cabernet Sauvignon, Chardonnay, Pinot noir, Sauvignon blanc, Syrah) that are now planted throughout the world, as well as wine-making practices and styles of wine that have been adopted in other producing countries. Although some producers have benefited in recent years from rising prices and increased demand for some of the prestige wines from Burgundy and Bordeaux, the French wine industry has seen a decline in domestic consumption and internationally, it has had to compete with many new world wines.

    "title": " Culinary Arts in Europe by Jean Anthelme Brillat-Savarin",
    "body": "2019/12/01 - The origins of culinary began with primitive humans roughly 2 million years ago. There are various theories as to how early humans used fire to cook meat. According to anthropologist Richard Wrangham, author of Catching Fire: How Cooking Made Us Human, primitive humans simply tossed a raw hunk of meat into the flames and watched it sizzle. Another theory claims humans may first have savoured roasted meat by chance when the flesh of a beast killed in a forest fire was found to be more appetizing and easier to chew and digest than the conventional raw meat. Culinary techniques improved with the introduction of earthenware and stoneware, the domestication of livestock, and advancements in agriculture. In early civilizations, the primary employers of professional chefs were kings, aristocrats, or priests. The divide between professional chefs cooking for the wealthy and peasants cooking for their families engendered the development of many cuisines. A great deal of the study of Culinary Arts in Europe was organized by Jean Anthelme Brillat-Savarin, a man famous for his quote “Tell me what you eat, and I will tell you what you are,” which has since been mistranslated and oversimplified into “You are what you eat. ” Other people helped to parse out the different parts of food science and gastronomy. Over time, increasingly deeper and more detailed studies into foods and the Culinary Arts has led to a greater wealth of knowledge. In Asia, a similar path led to a separate study of the Culinary Arts, which later essentially merged with the Western counterpart. In the modern international marketplace, there is no longer a distinct divide between Western and Eastern foods. Culinary Arts students today, generally speaking, are introduced to the different cuisines of many different cultures from around the world. The Culinary Arts, in the Western world, as a craft and later as a field of study, began to evolve at the end of the Renaissance period. Prior to this, chefs worked in castles, cooking for kings and queens, as well as their families, guests, and other workers of the castle. As Monarchical rule became phased out as a modality, the chefs took their craft to inns and hotels. From here, the craft evolved into a field of study. Before cooking institutions, professional cooks were mentors for individual students who apprenticed under them. In 1879, the first cooking school was founded in the United States: the Boston Cooking School. This school standardized cooking practices and recipes, and laid the groundwork for the culinary arts schools that would follow. "
